    <b>Marlboro Country</b> is the idyllic place that easily resembles the beautiful countryside often featured in a famous cigarette advertisement. It is locally known as <b>Rakuh a Payaman</b> which is a large communal pastureland, where livestock of mostly cows and carabaos can be seen grazing freely on the wide field.
