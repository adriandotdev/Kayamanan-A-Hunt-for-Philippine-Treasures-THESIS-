    Thank you for bringing this to me! I requested this when Zardo went to a particular place called Lake Sebu. Lake Sebu is one of the Philippinesâ€™ most important watersheds and a major provider of irrigation to the provinces of Sultan Kudarat and South Cotabato.

    It is home to the indigenous T'boli and Ubo tribes of the Philippines.

    There are 7 waterfalls whose water sources are from lake Sebu. There is a zipline which can help you see all of the five of the 7 waterfalls all at one ride because only 2 of the 7 waterfalls are accessible by foot.

    It is locally considered as the "Summer Capital of Southern Mindanao" and has a large Lotus flower field which the flowers only bloom from 5 am to 9 am.

    That's all if you want to recap the info just let me know.
